# ReactSketchPad

## Overview

ReactSketchPad is an intuitive and interactive line-drawing application built using React and TypeScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, visualizing, and manipulating lines on a canvas. This project is developed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and maintainability.

## Features

- **Two-Click Line Drawing**: Users can add lines by performing two clicks. The first click sets the starting point. As the mouse moves, the line dynamically extends from the starting point to the cursor's position. A second click sets the endpoint, adding the line to the canvas.
- **Contextual Right-Click Action**: If the user begins drawing and then right-clicks, the line in progress is discarded.
- **Intersection Indication**: Whenever a line intersects with another, a red dot appears at the intersection point, regardless of whether the line is being created or added to the canvas.
- **Line Collapse Animation**: A feature to "collapse lines" animates all lines converging to the center of each line within a 3-second timeframe.

## Technologies

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Ensures a well-organized code structure.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **React**: Offers a robust framework for building the user interface.
